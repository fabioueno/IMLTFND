    "Bayes Theorem helps us calculates the probabilities of an event given that another, related, happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind Naive Bayes is that we can say that the probability of an event $A$ given $B$ is **proportional** to the probability of the event $B$ given $A$ times the probability of $A$:\n",
